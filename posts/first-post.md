## Building a blog with clojure and clojurescript and babashka

Berry is a blog "engine" at least it will follow this path, 
to build my on blog engine, but why?
So, why not. I want learn more about the language and I want
write about it, so I decided to build my own blog with the language

There is no much to talk about right it now, but my whole idea
is build something using clojure and clojurescript so people 
in the js ecosistem could use easily, you just need to worry in
write the blog post. It need to be easy in the future change the 
template as well, if you follow some structure it will be easy change.

Remember this is a opinated blog engine, so it may not fit for you.
